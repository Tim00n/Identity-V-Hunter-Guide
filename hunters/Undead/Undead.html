        <h1 id="classification">1. Classification and Type</h1>
        <p>Undead is a fast chase single hit hunter. Not only can he quickly traverse the map with his dashes, but use them in chase to land hits or close distances quickly. Because of his ability to chase so well, he isn't allowed to camp at all and he has basically no cipher control.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/UndeadType.png" alt="Undead Chase">
        </div>
        <p>As a formidable chase hunter he's both capable and forced to end chases quickly. His abilities enable him to do this. He is very hard to transition against or kite in open areas. However, he is easily tight kited and looped.</p>

        <h1 id="external-traits">2. External Traits and Abilities</h1>
        <p>Undead has a few external traits and abilities in his kit that he can use to his advantage.</p>
        <p> Energy Charge is Undead's main gimmick besides Surrogate. It allows him to increase his Energy Load by using his abilities, which further enhances them and gives him certain passives. From 0-49 energy this simply does nothing and counts as "Uncharged". However, once the meter is between 50-99 Undead will enter an energy surge state during which his regular attack can break pallets and can't be interrupted. Both of his abilities will also be enhanced significantly. If his energy reaches 100 he will overload, which decreases movement speed by 8% and locks all abilities for 14 seconds.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Energy Charge.png" alt="Energy Charge">
        </div>
      <p>This means you can't get stunned by </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pallets</li>
            <li>Cricket balls</li>
            <li>Flare guns (Lucky Guy/Coordinator)</li>
            <li>Paintings (Painter)</li>
            <li>Stacks (Enchantress)</li>
            <li>Bees (Entomologist)</li>
            <li>Lasso (Cowboy)</li>
            <li>Magnets (Prospector)</li>
            <li>Flute (Antiquarian)</li>
            <li>Memory Fragment (Little Girl)</li>
            <li>Nitre Bombs (Acrobat)</li>

            <li>Flashlight (Thief)</li>
            <li>Rugby Ball (Forward)</li>
   
        </ul>
            
   
            
            <p>Note that this only applies when you are swinging, i.e., using your regular hit or one of the abilities. You can and will get stunned by all of these if you do not swing or do so improperly.</p>
            
            <p>Another essential ability to understand is Surrogate. Undead is the only hunter in IDV not able to chair or pick up a survivor at all. Instead, he only downs them to bleed them out, a process known as slugging.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./assets/Surrogate.png" alt="Surrogate Ability">
            </div>
            
            <p>This has many disadvantages but also a few advantages. It's important to keep in mind that every time a survivor is knocked down, elimination progress is increased by 25%. During this time, survivors can use up their self-heal once while their crawling speed is increased by 100%. Something to note is that this stacks with Sticker and counters Peepers because you can effectively crawl out of their radius fast enough.</p>
            
            <p>Surrogate also has a special effect, which increases the speed at which survivors bleed out by 300% when all of them are knocked down and when the gate is activated. It is important to keep in mind that this can stack up to 600%.</p>

            </div>
            
            
            <p>His last external trait, Frequency Conversion, lets Undead change the dungeon. It is completely random and shouldn't be changed for no good reason as it can only be done once.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">

        <p>It exposes his own location to the survivors who will also be notified as to where the new dungeon spawns. Undead isn't and he can also not cancel moving the dungeon. This is the main reason as to why it is insanely difficult to 4 man eliminate all survivors as Undead. Usually you will always have at least one escape. Another very important thing to keep in mind is that survivors can just run up to the dungeon while its being changed or crawl to it and jump inside to escape without Undead being able to do anything about it. This can be seen here</p>

        <p>As for his abilities Undead starts the game with 5 dashes  that deal damage upon hitting the survivor. Undead cannot control his dash unlike Smiley Face and it will end upon hitting a survivor, object or if the maximum distance is reached. It's important to keep in mind that Dashes aren't effected by Detention.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Kinetic Dash Hit.png" alt="Dash Ability">
        </div>
        <p>Every dash increases energy by 10. 5 dashes gets you to a charged state and energy level of 50. During this state his abilities are enhanced as desribed above. You can now jump chop hit or double slam survivors with the same abilities. This heavily improves your chase and allows you to pull off certain tricks otherwise not possible. </p>
        <p>The other ability is his charged strike, which is an AOE ranged attack that effects an area and increases in size the longer the button is held for. </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Charged Strike.png" alt="Charged Strike Ability">
        </div>
        <p>If it exceeds a certain threshhold the slam does damage. It also increases energy load by 20 so do not slam if your energy levels are 80+ unless you can warrant overloading. If your energy levels are 50+ then you can slam twice in a row. </p>
        
        <p>His last ability unlocks at full presence and simply lets him manage energy levels better. If you are below 50 you will jump to 50. It can also help you decrease your energy by 50 if necessary to prevent overcharge. This is often done between phases, meaning you use it when you are about to enter a chase so you can instantly break pallets and not get stunned or to decrease energy levels so you can dash normally again without overcharging. </p>

        <p>Overall, his abilities reflect a fast, agile, aggressive chase style focusing on quickly finishing chases.</p>

        <h1 id="persona-web">3. Persona Web and Traits</h1>
        <p>In this section different Persona Webs and Traits are discussed, which represent different strategies and styles. The go to persona for Undead is Detention and Confined Space. When making a persona web you always want to consider the hunters strengths and weaknesses. In Undeads case his strengths are apparent. As we know he doesn't have any camping abilities so points in these traits would be wasted. The reason why we bring Detention is because it can help Undead out a ton late game. While his dashes arent effected by it, you can use the dash to close distance and then a regular hit for an instant down. Detention is also justified, because the elimination speed is increased by 300% up to 600% after the gates are activated and if every survivor is knocked down. This gives the player a last chance to secure a tie or possibley turn a tie game into a win. </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Undead Persona.png" alt="Persona Web">
        </div>
<p>The main reason Confined Space is used is because of its prerequisites and because Undead due to his horrible regular hitbox and kit gets looped and tight kited very easily. He can counter transitioning survivors or fast survivors very well, but as soon as you start looping him around high walls he can't use his dashes properly and is forced to walk up to you and hit you. Confined Space puts a stop to this by blocking windows, which can enable these loops in the first place. It also gives you 3 stacks of Wither and Pallet Breaking, which combined with 2 stacks of Berserker make his chase a bit better. In case you dont have energy yet early game or you have to end up breaking a pallet it will go by rather quickly. And Wither combined with Berserker basically nullify a survivors chance of gaining any notable distance on you after the hit. 
</p>
<p>As for the trait you use with this strategy it comes down to personal preferences but usually Warp or Teleport. As discussed Undead has no cipher control and on larger maps like Moonlit 5 dashes won't be enough for chasing and mobility at the same time. Keep in mind you also have to tunnel the survivor thats knocked down somewhere on the map, which TP helps you do easily. It also gives you something to get to the gates late game. 

    The reason we don't use anything else is because its questionable or even useless. Excitement is completely useless, because in a charged state you are immune to stuns when swinging anyhow. 
    
    Peepers are good to help out against looping and tight kiting, but don't give you extra mobility and can be destroyed or simply crawled away from (keep in mind survivors crawl faster when downed). The healing slow down is also forgetable especially when you consider the fact that you want them to get up so you can down them again to increase their elimination speed by another 25%. 
    
    Undead's hitbox also isn't good enough to warrant using blink. His chase is also good enough to where you shouldn't need it. The same goes for Patroller.
    
    Some Undead's do use a Peeper strategy, but it generally speaking isn't recommend. A Peepers strategy would look something like this</p>
               
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="./assets/Undead2.png" alt="Undead Peepers Persona Web">
    </div>
    <p>Rarely you can also see Undead's bring abnormal. The reason as to why we don't bring Trump Card, is because you don't really need Hunters Instinct early game (2% movement speed boost), since you have the dashes and because Hospitable (Ballooning speed buff) is completely useless. Trump Card in theory sounds nice, but the issue is on larger maps ciphers are spread apart so much Abnormal and Peepers aren't worth it. You could experiment with it though and develop your own personal strategy. </p>

<h1>Arms Factory</h1>

<p>
    This is one of the worst maps you can bring Undead on. There are tons of areas where you can get looped, and many high walls and tight spaces make it difficult to optimally use your dashes. The Factory itself adds to these challenges.
</p>

<p>
    Some popular and helpful jump chop tricks can be found in the videos below:
</p>





<p>You need to try to make the best of an already terrible situation by limiting your risks of getting kited for too long. Do not chase someone in ruins or factory first. Try to get a fast down and snowball early game with as many incaps as possible. After that gear up for late game by wasting as many survivor resources as possible. Keeping Teleport for late game gate control is essential to either guarantee a tie or possibly aim for a win. Just keep in mind that in higher tier it is insanely difficult to even tie on Arms or Hospital so if you win you can definitely pat yourself on the back.</p>

<h1>Sacred Heart Hospital</h1>
<p>Hospital is probably the worst map ever to bring Undead on. You effectively can't dash in main building or ruins. Other areas are also a pain and there are many walls and loops or tight spaces to play around.</p>

<h1>Red Church</h1>
<p>Arguably the best small map for Undead that can be made to work the more experience you have with him. You can block Church's main windows with Confined Space and also other loops or the Shack Area.</p>

<h1>Leo's Memory</h1>

<h1>Lakeside Village</h1>
<p>Lakeside is a good map for Undead and pretty fun to play, because of just how many jump chop spots there are. There's plenty of open space.</p>

<h1>Moonlit River Park</h1>
<p>Moonlit isn't a bad map for Undead per se, but it can have its downside. It's really huge. So make sure to conserve your dashes for chasing and transitioning around the map carefully. Try to always have 1 dash on hand so the cooldown isn't as bad. For starters be sure to never chase someone at last stop first.</p>

<h1>Chinatown</h1>

<h1>Eversleeping Town</h1>
<p>Commonly agreed to be the best map for Undead it features tons of open space and few tight spaces or loops to work with for survivors.</p>

<p>Undead can also counter the tram if survivors do decide to use it as can be seen here. The slam works well in lots of other areas too for example this two pallet one window area if they drop it and you charge slam mid animation:</p>
